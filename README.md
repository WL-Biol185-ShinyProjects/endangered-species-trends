#Motivation for this app;
#The rate of extinctions of plant and animal species is increasing at a disheartening rate. We wanted to create a user friendly app that demonstrated the trends of species at different levels of IUCN classification (what species are threatened, endangered, vulnerable, etc.). We found data sets for both worldwide and US specific trends, so we wanted to find ways to best incorporate that data into our app. Hopefully, seeing this data in digestable graphs will be motivation to spend more effort in conserving species across the globe.
